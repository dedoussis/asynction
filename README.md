# Asynction
[![Tests Status](https://github.com/dedoussis/asynction/workflows/tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dedoussis/asynction/actions?query=workflow%3Atests) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/dedoussis/asynction/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=3720QP2994)](https://codecov.io/gh/dedoussis/asynction)

SocketIO python framework driven by the [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/) specification. Built on top of [Flask-SocketIO](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/Flask-SocketIO). Inspired by [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion).

The purpose of Asynction is to empower a specification first approach when developing [SocketIO](https://socket.io/) APIs in Python.

*Disclaimer: Asynction is still at a very early stage and should not be used in production codebases.*

## Features
* Payload validation (for both incoming and outgoing events), based on the message schemata within the API specification.
* Automatic registration of all event and error handlers defined within the API specification.

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.7 (or higher)

## Install
```bash
$ pip install asynction
```

## Usage
Example event and error handler callables located at `./my_api/handlers.py`:
```python
def user_sign_up(data):
    logger.info("Signing up user")

def user_log_in(data):
    logger.info("Logging in user")

def user_error(e):
    logger.error("Error: %s", e)
```

Example specification located at `./docs/asyncapi.yaml`:
```yaml
asyncapi: 2.0.0

info:
  title: User Account Service
  version: 1.0.0
  description: This service is in charge of processing user accounts

channels:
  /user:  # A channel is essentially a SocketIO namespace
    publish:
      message:
        oneOf:  # The oneOf Messages relationship expresses the supported events that a client may emit under the `user` namespace
          - $ref: '#/components/messages/UserSignUp'
          - $ref: '#/components/messages/UserLogIn'
    x-handers:  # Default namespace handlers (such as connect, disconnect and error)
      error: my_api.handlers.user_error  # Equivelant of: `@socketio.on_error("/user")

components:
  messages:
    UserSignUp:
      name: sign up  # The SocketIO event name
      payload:  # Asynction uses payload JSON Schemata for message validation
        type: object
      x-hander: my_api.handlers.user_sign_up  # The handler that is to be registered. Equivelant of: `@socketio.on("sign up", namespace="/user")
    UserLogIn:
      name: log in
      payload:
        type: object
      x-hander: my_api.handlers.user_log_in
```

Bootstrap the AsynctionSocketIO server:
```python
from asynction import AsynctionSocketIO
from flask import Flask

flask_app = Flask(__name__)

asio = AsynctionSocketIO.from_spec(
    spec_path="./docs/asyncapi.yaml",
    app=flask_app,
    message_queue="redis://",
    # any other kwarg that the flask_socketio.SocketIO constructor accepts
)
```
The `AsynctionSocketIO` class extends the `SocketIO` class of the Flask-SocketIO library.  
The above `asio` server object has all the event and error handlers registered, and is ready to run.  
Validation of the message payloads is also enabled by default.  
Without Asynction, one would need to add additional boilerplate to register the handlers (as shown [here](https://flask-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#error-handling)) and implement the respective validators.

## Specification Extentions
Asynction has extended the AsyncAPI 2.0.0 specification to provide support for coupling SocketIO entities (such as namespaces and events) to python objects (handlers). The extentions introduced adhere to the [Specification Extention guidelines](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/2.0.0#specificationExtensions) of the AsyncAPI spec.

### Event handler
The `x-handler` field MAY be defined as an additional property of the [Message Object](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/2.0.0#messageObject). The value of this field MUST be of `string` type, expressing a dot joint path to a python callable (the event handler).

Message Objects listed under a `subscribe` [operation](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/2.0.0#operationObject) MUST include the `x-handler` field.  
Message Objects listed under a `publish` [operation](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/2.0.0#operationObject) SHOULD NOT include the `x-handler` field.

### Default namespace handlers
The `x-handlers` field MAY be defined as an additional property of the [Channel Item Object](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/2.0.0#channelItemObject). The value of this field SHOULD be a [Channel Handlers Object](#channel-handlers-object).

#### Channel Handlers Object
| Field Name | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|
| connect  | `string` | Dot joint path to the python connect handler callable |
| disconnect | `string` | Dot joint path to the python disconnect handler callable |
| error | `string` | Dot joint path to the python error handler callable |

## TODOs
1. Binding validation
1. Authentication Ã  la https://connexion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security.html
1. Expose spec via a flask route. Provide a [playground](https://playground.asyncapi.io/?load=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asyncapi/asyncapi/master/examples/2.0.0/simple.yml).
1. Increase JSON Schema reference resolution test coverage. Allow refs to be used together with other keys. Merge upon ref resolution.

## Limitations / Thoughts
1. How can the spec express event handler return types (that are to be passed as args to the client callbacks)?

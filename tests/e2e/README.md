# End-to-end tests

Tests that assert the correctness of the [example](../../example) chat application using the locally developed `asynction` package.

This testing suite should be executed within the [docker compose](docker-compose.yml) setup using the `make test-e2e` target of the root [Makefile](../../Makefile).
